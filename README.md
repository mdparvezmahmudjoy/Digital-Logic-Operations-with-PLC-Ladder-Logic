# Digital Logic Operations with PLC Ladder Logic

A demonstration of fundamental bit logic operations using Ladder Diagram (LAD) in Siemens TIA Portal for S7 PLCs.

üìÅ Project Contents
This repository contains:

1.Bit_Logic_Operations_S7_LAD (TIA Portal Project)

    Main Siemens project file with LAD logic implementations.

    Includes OBs, FBs, and DBs for structured programming.

2.3D_Model_Factory_IO

    Interactive 3D simulation model (compatible with Factory I/O).

    Visualizes PLC logic in an industrial automation context.

3.Schematic_Program_Block.pdf

    PDF documentation of the program structure and logic flow.

    Annotated ladder diagrams for easy reference.

4.Demo_Video.mp4

    Step-by-step walkthrough of project operations.

    Shows real-time responses to input triggers.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Software:

    Siemens TIA Portal (V16 or later).

    Factory I/O (optional, for 3D simulation).

Hardware:

    Compatible S7 PLC (e.g., S7-1200/S7-1500) or PLCSIM Advanced for virtual testing.
